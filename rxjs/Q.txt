1.What is the difference between an observable and a Promise?

Promise:

A promise has a single callback at the end of completion or failure.
A promise is not Lazy. It cannot be cancelled.
Observable:

An observable emits multiple values over time.
You may cancel an obeservable with an Unsubscribe() method.
An observable only executes once subscribed to it.
Provides efficient operators: map, reduce, foreach, filter, reduce, retry, retryWhen.

What are RxJS Operators ?
These are methods that can be applied to the observable in order to modify the data stream.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Observers and Subscriptions ?
Observers: They are the listeners/ consumers of the data stream; Observers listen /subscribe to the data stream.
Subscribers: - Objects returned when an observable is subscribed; Useful in canceling the subscription.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In RxJS, a Subject is a special type of observable that allows you to multicast values to multiple observers. 
Unlike a regular observable, which only emits values to its subscribers, a Subject can be both an observable and an observer.
This means it can emit values to its subscribers and also receive new values from other sources.

Here are some key characteristics of a Subject:

Multicasting: A Subject can broadcast values to multiple subscribers.
When you subscribe to a Subject, you receive the values emitted by the Subject, and all subscribers receive the same values at the same time.

Both Observable and Observer: A Subject can act as an observable (you can subscribe to it) and as an observer (you can call next(), error(), and complete() on it).
This makes it possible to push new values into the Subject which will then be emitted to all its subscribers.

State Management: Subject does not hold any value internally. Each subscriber receives values from the point in time they subscribe onwards.
If you need a Subject that remembers the latest value and emits it to new subscribers, you can use BehaviorSubject instead.

No Initial Value: A Subject does not provide any initial value when it's created. 
For an initial value, you would use BehaviorSubject, which requires an initial value.

import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

// Create a new Subject
const subject = new Subject();

// Subscribe to the Subject
subject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Observer 1: ${value}`)
});

// Emit values to the Subject
subject.next('Hello');
subject.next('World');

// Another subscriber
subject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Observer 2: ${value}`)
});

// Emit another value
subject.next('!');

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are different types of Subject ? 
RxJS provides several types of Subject, each with its own behavior and use cases.
Here’s a summary of the main types:

Subject
BehaviorSubject
ReplaySubject
AsyncSubject

1.Subject
Behavior: A Subject is a multicast observable that can emit new values to its subscribers.
It does not store any values, so subscribers only receive values that are emitted after they subscribe.
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

const subject = new Subject();

// First subscriber
subject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Subscriber 1: ${value}`)
});

// Emit values
subject.next('A');
subject.next('B');

// Second subscriber
subject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Subscriber 2: ${value}`)
});

// Emit more values
subject.next('C');

Output:
Subscriber 1: A
Subscriber 1: B
Subscriber 1: C
Subscriber 2: C

....................................................

Example:

BehaviorSubject
Behavior: A BehaviorSubject requires an initial value and always emits the latest value to new subscribers. 
It remembers the last emitted value and provides it to any new subscribers immediately upon subscription.

import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

const behaviorSubject = new BehaviorSubject('Initial Value');

// First subscriber
behaviorSubject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Subscriber 1: ${value}`)
});

// Emit values
behaviorSubject.next('A');
behaviorSubject.next('B');

// Second subscriber
behaviorSubject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Subscriber 2: ${value}`)
});

// Emit more values
behaviorSubject.next('C');

Output:
Subscriber 1: Initial Value  // First subscriber gets the initial value upon subscription.
Subscriber 1: A             // First subscriber receives 'A'.
Subscriber 1: B             // First subscriber receives 'B'.
Subscriber 2: B             // Second subscriber subscribes and gets the most recent value, which is 'B'.
Subscriber 1: C             // Both subscribers receive 'C'.
Subscriber 2: C


....................................................
ReplaySubject
Behavior: A ReplaySubject can be configured to replay a specified number of past values to new subscribers. 
It can also be set to replay values for a specified time period.

import { ReplaySubject } from 'rxjs';

const replaySubject = new ReplaySubject(2); // Buffer size of 2

// First subscriber
replaySubject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Subscriber 1: ${value}`)
});

// Emit values
replaySubject.next('A');
replaySubject.next('B');
replaySubject.next('C');

// Second subscriber
replaySubject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Subscriber 2: ${value}`)
});

Output :
Subscriber 1: A
Subscriber 1: B
Subscriber 1: C
Subscriber 2: B
Subscriber 2: C
...................................................

AsyncSubject
Behavior: An AsyncSubject only emits the last value to its subscribers when the observable completes. 
If the observable does not complete, subscribers will not receive any values.

Example:
import { AsyncSubject } from 'rxjs';

const asyncSubject = new AsyncSubject();

// First subscriber
asyncSubject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Subscriber 1: ${value}`)
});

// Emit values
asyncSubject.next('A');
asyncSubject.next('B');

// Complete the observable
asyncSubject.complete();

// Second subscriber
asyncSubject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Subscriber 2: ${value}`)
});

Output :
Subscriber 1: B
Subscriber 2: B

In this example, only the last value 'B' is emitted to subscribers after the AsyncSubject completes.

First Subscriber:

When asyncSubject.next('A') is called, no values are emitted yet because AsyncSubject doesn't emit anything until complete() is called.
When asyncSubject.next('B') is called, again, nothing is emitted yet, but AsyncSubject stores 'B' as the most recent value.
When asyncSubject.complete() is called, the last emitted value 'B' is sent to all existing subscribers. Therefore, the first subscriber receives B and prints:

Second Subscriber:

After the complete() method has been called, AsyncSubject still holds onto the last emitted value ('B').
When the second subscriber subscribes, it immediately receives the last value stored by the AsyncSubject because it had already completed. 
So, the second subscriber also receives B and prints it .

Key Concept:
AsyncSubject only emits the last value when it's completed.
All subscribers (whether they subscribe before or after the subject completes) will receive that last value if the subject has been completed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In RxJS, a Scheduler is a tool that controls when and how tasks are executed, including when observables are subscribed to, when values are emitted, and when operators are applied. 

Types of schedulers: queueScheduler, asapScheduler, asyncScheduler, animationFrameScheduler
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a custom operator.

Steps to Create a Custom Operator
Define the Custom Operator Function:

It should accept an observable as input and return a transformed observable.
It can use operators like map, filter, or mergeMap internally to manipulate the stream.
Create the Operator Using Observable.create or pipe:

You can define custom logic in your operator, and optionally use other RxJS operators inside your custom operator.

Example 1: Simple Custom Operator (Log Values)
Let’s say we want to create a custom operator that logs each value emitted by the observable.


import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

function logValues<T>(source: Observable<T>): Observable<T> {
  return new Observable<T>(observer => {
    source.subscribe({
      next(value) {
        console.log(value); // Log the value
        observer.next(value); // Pass the value to the observer
      },
      error(err) {
        observer.error(err); // Pass the error
      },
      complete() {
        observer.complete(); // Complete the stream
      }
    });
  });
}

// Usage
import { of } from 'rxjs';

const source$ = of(1, 2, 3);

source$.pipe(
  logValues
).subscribe({
  next: value => console.log(`Emitted: ${value}`),
  complete: () => console.log('Completed')
});

Output:
1
Emitted: 1
2
Emitted: 2
3
Emitted: 3
Completed
