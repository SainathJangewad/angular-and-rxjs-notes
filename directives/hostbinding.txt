@HostBinding Decorator
Purpose: Binds a DOM property, class, style, or attribute of the host element to a directive property.
Change Detection: Angular automatically updates the host element if the bound property changes during change detection.
Usage:
Classes: Prefix with class. to bind classes.
Styles: Prefix with style. to bind styles (supports units like px).
Attributes: Prefix with attr. to bind attributes.
Properties: Directly bind to DOM properties.


Example Bindings:

Class: 
@HostBinding('class.valid') get valid() { return this.control.valid; }

Style:
@HostBinding('style.color') get color() { return this.control.valid ? 'green' : 'red'; }
@HostBinding('style.width.px') @Input() width: number = 500;


Attribute:
@HostBinding('attr.aria-required') @Input() required: boolean = false;


Property:
@HostBinding('id') get id() { return this.control.value?.length ? 'odd' : 'even'; }


Custom directives in Angular are a powerful feature that allows you to extend the behavior of DOM elements.
They are useful in many real-world scenarios, particularly for creating reusable and maintainable code. 
Here are some common use cases where custom directives can be applied in real-world projects:



1.DOM Manipulation
Example: You can create directives to manipulate the DOM directly, such as adding or removing classes, setting attributes, or modifying styles based on conditions.
Use Case: Highlighting certain fields based on validation results or user interactions.
Example: appHighlight directive that changes the background color of an element.

2. Input Validation & Formatting
Example: Create directives to automatically validate user inputs, such as ensuring the correct format for dates, phone numbers, or emails.
Use Case: Validating form fields or auto-formatting values.
Example: A directive that formats a number input as a currency.

<input appCurrencyFormat type="text">


3. Tooltips and Popups
Example: A custom directive can be used to show tooltips when hovering over elements, or to display popups on specific user actions.
Use Case: Displaying additional information or help text when hovering over a button or link.
Example: A tooltip directive that shows a message when the user hovers over an element.

<button appTooltip="This is a tooltip!">Hover me</button>


4. Custom Event Handling
Example: Use directives to attach custom event listeners and handle complex events such as swipe, drag-and-drop, or double-click.
Use Case: Implementing custom behaviors like detecting a "swipe to delete" action on mobile.
Example: A appSwipe directive to handle swipe gestures.

<div appSwipe (swipe)="onSwipe()">Swipe Here</div>


5. Reusable Behavior (DRY Principle)
Example: Any reusable logic or behavior that applies to multiple components can be encapsulated in a directive.
Use Case: Instead of repeating code across components, you create a directive to encapsulate common functionality (e.g., autofocus, input masking, or automatically resizing text areas).
Example: Autofocus directive that sets focus on the input when the component loads.

<input appAutoFocus>


6.Accessing and Modifying Host Element Properties
Example: You can create directives that access the host element and modify its properties or behaviors.
Use Case: Automatically scroll a container to the bottom (for chat windows), or auto-expand a textarea as the user types.
Example: Scroll to bottom directive.

<div appScrollToBottom>Chat messages...</div>

7. Handling Scroll Events
Example: Custom directives can handle scroll events and trigger logic based on scroll position.
Use Case: Infinite scrolling where more content loads when the user scrolls to the bottom of a page.

<div appInfiniteScroll (scrolled)="loadMore()">Content</div>


Summary of Common Use Cases:
DOM Manipulation (e.g., highlighting, conditional styles)
Input Validation and Formatting (e.g., formatting dates or numbers)
Tooltips and Popups (e.g., showing help text on hover)
Event Handling (e.g., swipe detection, custom click events)
Reusable Behavior (e.g., autofocus, input masking)
Accessibility Enhancements (e.g., dynamic ARIA attributes)
Animations (e.g., fade-in, slide animations)
Handling Scroll and Resize Events (e.g., infinite scrolling, auto-resizing)
