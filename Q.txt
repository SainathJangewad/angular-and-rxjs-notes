How does an Angular application work?
Answer:
Every Angular app consists of a file named angular.json.
This file will contain all the configurations of the app. 
While building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the entry point of the application. 
Following is the code  of the angular.json file:

"build": {
        "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
        "options": {
          "outputPath": "dist/angular-starter",
          "index": "src/index.html",
          "main": "src/main.ts",
          "polyfills": "src/polyfills.ts",
          "tsConfig": "tsconfig.app.json",
          "aot": false,
          "assets": [
            "src/favicon.ico",
            "src/assets"
          ],
          "styles": [
            "./node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/deeppurple-amber.css",
            "src/style.css"
          ]
        }
      }

Inside the build section, the main property of the options object defines the entry point of the application which in this case is main.ts.

The main.ts file creates a browser environment for the application to run, and, along with this, it also calls a function called bootstrapModule, which bootstraps the application.
These two steps are performed in the following order inside the main.ts file: 
main.ts looks like this :

import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

In the above line of code, AppModule is getting bootstrapped.

The AppModule is declared in the app.module.ts file. This module contains declarations of all the components.

Below is an example of app.module.ts file:  

 import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
      import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
      import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

      @NgModule({
        declarations: [
          AppComponent
        ],
        imports: [
          BrowserModule
        ],
        providers: [],
        entryComponents: [],
        bootstrap: [AppComponent]
      })
      export class AppModule { }

As one can see in the above file, AppComponent is getting bootstrapped.

The root component (AppComponent) defined in the AppModule is bootstrapped. This component is the entry point of the Angular application and its template is rendered. 
The template can include other components, creating a component hierarchy.

After this, Angular calls the index.html file. This file consequently calls the root component that is app-root.
The root component is defined in app.component.ts. This is how the index.html file looks:
<!doctype html>
      <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Angular</title>
        <base href="/">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      </head>
      <body>
        <app-root></app-root>
      </body>
      </html>

The HTML template of the root component is displayed inside the <app-root> tags.
This is how every angular application works.

Advantages and disadvantage of angular ?

Advantages:

Features that are provided out of the box - Angular provides a number of built-in features like routing, state management, rxjs library and http servicesstraight out of the box. 
This means that one does not need to look for the above-stated features separately. 
They are all provided with angular.

Two-Way Data Binding:
Angular synchronizes data between the model and the view, which simplifies development and ensures data consistency.

Component-Based Architecture:
It promotes better code organization, reusability, and maintainability through its modular component-based structure.

Strong Community Support:
Supported by Google, Angular has a robust community, extensive documentation, and a large ecosystem of libraries and tools.

Angular CLI:
The Angular Command Line Interface simplifies the development workflow with commands for setting up projects, development, testing, and deployment.

Disadvantages:

Complexity:
Angular’s extensive feature set and architecture can be challenging for beginners, resulting in a steep learning curve.

Performance Issues:
Large applications may experience performance problems if not managed properly, especially with Angular’s two-way data binding.

Verbosity:
Angular code can be verbose, requiring more boilerplate code compared to other frameworks, which can slow down development.

Migration Challenges:
Upgrading to newer versions of Angular can be difficult, often requiring significant refactoring and dealing with breaking changes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advantages of Angular over React:

Bidirectional Data Binding:

Angular supports bidirectional data binding, which means changes in the model automatically update the view and vice versa.
 React, on the other hand, supports only unidirectional data binding and requires manual updates for changes in the view.

Dependency Injection:
Angular comes with built-in dependency injection, which simplifies the management of dependencies and enhances modularity and testability.
React relies on third-party libraries or custom solutions for dependency injection.

Full-Stack Development:
Angular can be used for both web and mobile development (with Angular Native), making it versatile for full-stack applications.
React is primarily used for building user interfaces and requires additional libraries or frameworks for mobile development (like React Native).

Built-In Tools and Libraries:
Angular provides a wide range of built-in tools, libraries, frameworks, and plugins, which streamline development and offer a comprehensive development environment. React often relies on third-party libraries to achieve similar functionality.

TypeScript:
Angular uses TypeScript, which adds static typing and other features that help in catching errors early and improving code quality.
React primarily uses JavaScript, although it can be used with TypeScript as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Differences between AngularJS and Angular:

Architecture:
AngularJS: Uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. 
The Model contains business logic, the Controller processes information, and the View displays the information from the Model.
Angular: Replaces controllers with Components.
Components are directives with a predefined template, offering a more organized and modular approach to building user interfaces.

Language:
AngularJS: Uses JavaScript, a dynamically typed language.
Angular: Uses TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript.
TypeScript enhances performance and helps with developing larger applications due to its static typing features.

Mobile Support:

AngularJS: Does not provide built-in support for mobile development.
Angular: Provides support for all popular mobile browsers, making it more suitable for mobile applications.

Structure:
AngularJS: Maintaining code for larger applications can become tedious due to its structure.
Angular: Offers a better structure for maintaining code in larger applications, making it easier to manage and scale.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are Single Page Applications (SPA)?
Single page applications are web based applications that only need to be loaded once, with new functionality consisting of only minor changes to the user interface.
It does not load new HTML pages to display the content of the new page, but rather generates it dynamically. 
This is made feasible by JavaScript's ability to alter DOM components on the current page. 
A Single Page Application method is speedier, resulting in a more consistent user experience.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are templates in Angular?
A template is a kind of HTML that instructs Angular about how to display a component. An Angular HTML template, like conventional HTML, produces a view, or user interface, in the browser, but with far more capabilities. Angular API evaluates an HTML template of a component, creates HTML, and renders it.

There are two ways to create a template in an Angular component:

Inline Template
Linked Template
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is data binding in Angular?.

Data binding in Angular is a mechanism that allows the synchronization of data between the model and the view. Angular provides four types of data binding:

Interpolation (String Interpolation)
Property Binding
Event Binding
Two-Way Binding
Let's discuss each type with examples.

1. Interpolation (String Interpolation)
Interpolation allows you to embed expressions in your HTML. It uses double curly braces {{}}.

Example:
<!-- app.component.html -->
<p>{{ message }}</p>
// app.component.ts
export class AppComponent {
  message: string = 'Hello, Angular!';
}
..........................................
2. Property Binding
Property binding is used to bind values to the properties of HTML elements or Angular components.

Example:

html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<img [src]="imageUrl" alt="Angular Logo"> 
// app.component.ts
export class AppComponent {
  imageUrl: string = 'https://angular.io/assets/images/logos/angular/angular.png';
}
Here, the src attribute of the img element is bound to the imageUrl property in the component.
..........................................
3. Event Binding
Event binding is used to bind events to methods in the component. It uses parentheses ().
..........................................

4. Two-Way Binding
Two-way binding allows for the synchronization of data in both directions: from the component to the view and from the view to the component.
 It uses the ngModel directive and is achieved using [( )] syntax.

 <!-- app.component.html -->
<input [(ngModel)]="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
<p>Hello, {{ name }}!</p>

// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html'
})
export class AppComponent {
  name: string = '';
}
In this example, the value of the input field is bound to the name property in the component,
and any changes in the input field will reflect in the name property and vice versa.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are Decorators and their types in Angular?

Decorators are a fundamental concept in TypeScript, and because Angular heavily relies on TypeScript, decorators have become an important element of Angular as well.
Decorators are methods or design patterns that are labeled with a prefixed @ symbol and preceded by a class, method, or property.
They enable the modification of a service, directive, or filter before it is utilized. 
A decorator, in essence, provides configuration metadata that specifies how a component, class, or method should be processed, constructed, and used at runtime. 
Angular includes a number of decorators which attach various types of metadata to classes, allowing the system to understand what all these classes signify and how they should function.

There are four main types of decorators in Angular:

Class Decorators
Property Decorators
Method Decorators
Parameter Decorators

1. Class Decorators
Class decorators are used to attach metadata to a class. The most common class decorator in Angular is the @Component decorator, which defines a component.

Example:
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1>',
  styleUrls: ['./example.component.css']
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  name: string = 'Angular';
}
In this example, the @Component decorator is used to define a new component called ExampleComponent.
The metadata includes the selector, template, and style URLs.
........................................

2. Property Decorators
Property decorators are used to attach metadata to properties within a class. Common property decorators include @Input and @Output.
Example using @Input:
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: '<p>{{childMessage}}</p>'
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() childMessage: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: '<app-child [childMessage]="parentMessage"></app-child>'
})
export class ParentComponent {
  parentMessage: string = 'Message from parent';
}
In this example, the @Input decorator allows the childMessage property in ChildComponent to receive data from the ParentComponent.
........................................

3. Method Decorators
Method decorators are used to attach metadata to methods within a class. A common method decorator is @HostListener.

Example using @HostListener:
import { Directive, HostListener } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appClickTracker]'
})
export class ClickTrackerDirective {
  @HostListener('click', ['$event'])
  onClick(event: Event): void {
    console.log('Element clicked:', event);
  }
}
In this example, the @HostListener decorator is used to listen for click events on the host element
and execute the onClick method whenever a click occurs.
........................................

4. Parameter Decorators
Parameter decorators are used to attach metadata to the parameters of class constructors. A common parameter decorator is @Inject.

Example using @Inject.
import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { MAT_DIALOG_DATA } from '@angular/material/dialog';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-dialog',
  template: '<p>{{data.message}}</p>'
})
export class DialogComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) public data: any) {}
}

in this example, the @Inject decorator is used to inject the MAT_DIALOG_DATA into the DialogComponent constructor, allowing it to receive data passed to the dialog.

These decorators are essential for defining and configuring Angular applications, making it easier to create complex functionalities with concise and readable code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Annotations in Angular are a specific type of metadata that provide additional information about a class and its behavior. 
They are a key feature of Angular and are closely related to decorators. 
Annotations are used by Angular's compiler to understand the structure and configuration of an Angular application.

Annotations in Angular are essentially metadata attached to a class via decorators, and they describe the class's configuration in terms of the framework. 
The most common annotations in Angular are @Component, @Directive, @Pipe, @Injectable, and @NgModule.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are HTTP interceptors ?

HTTP interceptors in Angular are a powerful feature that allows you to inspect and modify HTTP requests and responses.
They are part of the Angular HTTP client module and are implemented as services that implement the HttpInterceptor interface.

Key Features of HTTP Interceptors

Modify Requests: Interceptors can modify HTTP requests before they are sent to the server. For example, you can add headers, modify request parameters, or log requests.

Handle Responses: Interceptors can inspect and modify responses before they reach the application code.
This is useful for handling common tasks such as error handling, logging, or modifying the response data.

Global HTTP Configuration: Interceptors apply to all HTTP requests made by the Angular application, making them a convenient way to implement cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, and error handling.
.....................................
Implementing an HTTP Interceptor
To create an HTTP interceptor, you need to implement the HttpInterceptor interface, which requires you to define the intercept method.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating an HTTP interceptor:

Create the Interceptor Service:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler, HttpEvent } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    const authToken = 'your-auth-token';

    // Clone the request to add the new header
    const authReq = req.clone({
      headers: req.headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
    });

    // Pass on the cloned request instead of the original request
    return next.handle(authReq);
  }
}

2.Provide the Interceptor:
You need to register the interceptor in your Angular module using the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS token.
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { AuthInterceptor } from './auth.interceptor';

@NgModule({
  imports: [HttpClientModule],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
      useClass: AuthInterceptor,
      multi: true
    }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
The multi: true option allows multiple interceptors to be registered.

WHAT is "multi:true" ?

In Angular, the multi: true option is used when providing services to allow multiple values to be associated with a single token. 
This is particularly useful with HTTP interceptors because it allows you to register multiple interceptors that will be applied in the order they are provided.

Why multi: true is Important

When you set multi: true for a provider, Angular expects the value of the provider to be an array, and it will add your provided service to this array. 
Without multi: true, Angular would overwrite any previous providers for the same token, meaning you could only have one interceptor.

Example with Multiple Interceptors
Let's say you want to create two different interceptors: one for adding an authorization token and another for logging HTTP requests and responses.

1.Authorization Interceptor:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler, HttpEvent } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    const authToken = 'your-auth-token';

    const authReq = req.clone({
      headers: req.headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
    });

    return next.handle(authReq);
  }
}

2.Logging Interceptor:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler, HttpEvent } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { tap } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class LoggingInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    console.log('HTTP Request:', req);

    return next.handle(req).pipe(
      tap(
        event => console.log('HTTP Response:', event),
        error => console.error('HTTP Error:', error)
      )
    );
  }
}

3.Providing Multiple Interceptors:
In your AppModule, you register both interceptors using the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS token and set multi: true.

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { AuthInterceptor } from './auth.interceptor';
import { LoggingInterceptor } from './logging.interceptor';

@NgModule({
  imports: [HttpClientModule],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
      useClass: AuthInterceptor,
      multi: true
    },
    {
      provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
      useClass: LoggingInterceptor,
      multi: true
    }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }

What Happens with multi: true
Angular collects all the interceptors into an array associated with the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS token.
When an HTTP request is made, Angular processes each interceptor in the order they were provided.
Each interceptor gets the opportunity to modify the request or handle the response before passing it to the next interceptor.

Summary
multi: true: Allows multiple interceptors (or any service) to be registered under the same token.
Order of Interceptors: Interceptors are executed in the order they are provided.
Benefits: Enables separation of concerns, such as separate interceptors for authentication, logging, error handling, etc.

What is view encapsulation in Angular?

View encapsulation in Angular is a mechanism to apply styles to components in a way that they are scoped to the component, preventing them from affecting other parts of the application. Angular provides three encapsulation modes:

Emulated (default)
None
ShadowDom

1. Emulated
Emulated encapsulation mode emulates the behavior of Shadow DOM by adding unique attributes to component elements and their styles. 
This ensures that styles defined in a component do not leak out and affect other components.

Example:

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-emulated',
  template: `
    <div class="example">Emulated Encapsulation</div>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .example {
      color: red;
    }
  `],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated
})
export class EmulatedComponent { }

In this example, Angular will modify the CSS classes and attributes to ensure the styles are scoped to the EmulatedComponent.

Rendered HTML:
<div _ngcontent-c0 class="example">Emulated Encapsulation</div>
<style>
  .example[_ngcontent-c0] {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

.......................................................

2. None
None encapsulation mode means no encapsulation. Styles defined in a component will be applied globally, affecting other components in the application.

import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-none',
  template: `
    <div class="example">No Encapsulation</div>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .example {
      color: blue;
    }
  `],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
})
export class NoneComponent { }

In this example, the styles defined in NoneComponent will apply to all elements with the class example across the application.

Rendered HTML:
<div class="example">No Encapsulation</div>
<style>
  .example {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

.......................................................

3. Shadow DOM Encapsulation
ShadowDom encapsulation leverages the native Shadow DOM feature available in modern browsers. 
Shadow DOM allows you to attach a hidden, separate DOM tree to an element, providing true encapsulation of styles and markup.

When you use ShadowDom encapsulation in Angular, the component's template and styles are encapsulated inside a shadow root, creating a boundary that prevents styles from leaking out or being affected by global styles.

Example: Shadow DOM Encapsulation
Let's walk through a detailed example to illustrate how ShadowDom works.

Component Definition:
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-shadow-dom',
  template: `
    <div class="example">Shadow DOM Encapsulation</div>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .example {
      color: green;
    }
  `],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom
})
export class ShadowDomComponent { }

Rendered HTML:
When Angular renders this component in the DOM, 
it creates a shadow root and attaches the component's template and styles inside this shadow root.

<app-shadow-dom>
  #shadow-root (closed)
  <style>
    .example {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
  <div class="example">Shadow DOM Encapsulation</div>
</app-shadow-dom>
Key Points of Shadow DOM Encapsulation
Isolation:

The styles defined inside the shadow root do not affect elements outside the shadow DOM.
External styles do not affect elements inside the shadow DOM.
Encapsulation:

The component's template and styles are fully encapsulated within the shadow root.
This provides a clean separation between the component's internal styles and the rest of the application.
Browser Support:

Modern browsers support Shadow DOM natively. However, older browsers might require polyfills to fully support Shadow DOM features.

How to implement lazy loading in angular ?

Lazy loading in Angular is a design pattern that allows you to load feature modules only when they are needed. 
This can significantly improve the performance of your application by reducing the initial load time. 
Lazy loading in Angular is typically implemented using the Angular Router.

Steps to Implement Lazy Loading in Angular
-Create a Feature Module
-Configure the Routes
-Set Up the Lazy Loading Route in the App Module

 Generate the Module and Component

ng generate module admin --route admin --module app.module
ng generate component admin/admin-dashboard

admin-routing.module.ts

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { AdminDashboardComponent } from './admin-dashboard/admin-dashboard.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: AdminDashboardComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AdminRoutingModule { }


admin.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { AdminDashboardComponent } from './admin-dashboard/admin-dashboard.component';
import { AdminRoutingModule } from './admin-routing.module';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AdminDashboardComponent],
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    AdminRoutingModule
  ]
})
export class AdminModule { }


app-routing.module.ts

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'admin', loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.module').then(m => m.AdminModule) },
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: '/home' }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }


Here's an ASCII diagram showing a typical folder structure for a lazy-loaded module in an Angular application.

my-angular-app/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── admin/
│   │   │   ├── admin-dashboard/
│   │   │   │   ├── admin-dashboard.component.ts
│   │   │   │   ├── admin-dashboard.component.html
│   │   │   │   ├── admin-dashboard.component.css
│   │   │   ├── admin-routing.module.ts
│   │   │   ├── admin.module.ts
│   │   ├── app-routing.module.ts
│   │   ├── app.component.ts
│   │   ├── app.component.html
│   │   ├── app.component.css
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── environments/
│   ├── styles.css


The ng generate module admin --route admin --module app.
module command is used in Angular CLI to generate a new module with routing and configure it for lazy loading. Let’s break down this command and its syntax:

Command Breakdown
ng generate module: This is the Angular CLI command to generate a new module.
admin: This specifies the name of the module you want to create. In this case, the module will be named AdminModule.
--route admin: This flag tells Angular CLI to create a route configuration for the new module.
It sets up the lazy loading for the module and creates a route for it. The path for this route will be admin.
--module app.module: This flag specifies that the route configuration for lazy loading should be added to the AppModule.
This ensures that the new module is registered for lazy loading in the main application module.
