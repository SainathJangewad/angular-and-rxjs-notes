useClass Provider

The useClass provider lets you specify a class that Angular should instantiate and provide when a particular token is requested.
This class doesn't necessarily have to be the same as the token; it can be an alternative implementation.

Syntax:
providers: [
  { provide: Token, useClass: Class }
]

provide: The DI token, typically a class or an interface.
useClass: The class to instantiate when the token is requested.

You can use this type of provider to substitute an alternative implementation for a common or default class. The alternative implementation can, for example, implement a different strategy, extend the default class, or emulate the behavior of the real class in a test case.
....................................................
In the following example, BetterLogger would be instantiated when the Logger dependency is requested in a component or any other class:

src/app/app.component.ts
[{ provide: Logger, useClass: BetterLogger }]

If the alternative class providers have their own dependencies, specify both providers in the providers metadata property of the parent module or component:

src/app/app.component.ts
[
  UserService, // dependency needed in `EvenBetterLogger`.
  { provide: Logger, useClass: EvenBetterLogger },// Depends on UserService
]

Why Mention UserService Before { provide: Logger, useClass: EvenBetterLogger }
Dependency Resolution: EvenBetterLogger depends on UserService (via its constructor). Angular must know how to provide UserService before it can instantiate EvenBetterLogger.

Order Matters: In the providers array, UserService must be listed first so that it’s available for injection into EvenBetterLogger.

Error Prevention: Without UserService in providers, Angular will throw a NullInjectorError when resolving dependencies for EvenBetterLogger.


In this example, EvenBetterLogger displays the user name in the log message. This logger gets the user from an injected UserService instance:

src/app/even-better-logger.component.ts

@Injectable()
export class EvenBetterLogger extends Logger {
  constructor(private userService: UserService) {}
  override log(message: string) {
    const name = this.userService.user.name;
    super.log(`Message to ${name}: ${message}`);
  }
}
Angular DI knows how to construct the UserService dependency, since it has been configured above and is available in the injector.

Alias Providers: useExisting

In Angular, the useExisting provider allows you to create an alias for an existing provider. Instead of instantiating a new class or service, Angular reuses an already provided instance. This is useful when you want to assign multiple tokens to the same service instance.

Syntax:
{ provide: NewToken, useExisting: ExistingToken }

provide: The new token (alias) you want to use.
useExisting: The existing token or service that you want to alias.

src/app/app.component.ts
[
  NewLogger,
  // Alias OldLogger w/ reference to NewLogger
  { provide: OldLogger, useExisting: NewLogger},
]
Note: Ensure you do not alias OldLogger to NewLogger with useClass, as this creates two different NewLogger instances.

When to Use
When multiple services or components need to refer to the same instance but should have different names (tokens).
To avoid creating duplicate instances of services with the same functionality.

Factory Providers: useFactory

The useFactory provider in Angular allows you to create and provide a service using a factory function. This is useful when you need more control over the instantiation of a service, such as creating instances dynamically based on some condition or with specific parameters.

Syntax:
{ provide: ServiceToken, useFactory: factoryFunction, deps: [dependencies] }

provide: The DI token (service or value) you want to provide.
useFactory: The factory function that returns the instance of the service.
deps (optional): An array of dependencies that should be injected into the factory function.

When to Use
When you need to control the instantiation of a service, especially when it depends on dynamic conditions.
When you need to inject different instances of a service based on the environment or configuration.

Example: Controlling Access to Secret Heroes

Service: HeroService
class HeroService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger, private isAuthorized: boolean) {}
  getHeroes() {
    return HEROES.filter(hero => this.isAuthorized || !hero.isSecret);
  }
}

Factory Function:
src/app/heroes/hero.service.provider.ts
const heroServiceFactory = (logger: Logger, userService: UserService) =>
  new HeroService(logger, userService.user.isAuthorized);


  Factory Provider:
  src/app/heroes/hero.service.provider.ts
  export const heroServiceProvider = {
  provide: HeroService,
  useFactory: heroServiceFactory,
  deps: [Logger, UserService],
};

How It Works:
Angular calls heroServiceFactory to create HeroService.
Injects Logger and UserService based on deps.
Factory function uses userService.user.isAuthorized to decide access and returns the service instance.
Benefits:
Dynamic Instantiation: Create services based on runtime logic.
Custom Dependencies: Pass calculated or external values during service creation.
Reusability: Exporting the provider makes it reusable across modules.
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Value Providers: useValue

A value provider in Angular allows you to supply a fixed or constant value for a dependency instead of creating it dynamically. This is useful for things like configuration settings, static data, or shared constants across the app.


Use this technique to provide runtime configuration constants such as website base addresses and feature flags. You can also use a value provider in a unit test to provide mock data in place of a production data service.

Using an InjectionToken object
Use an InjectionToken object as provider token for non-class dependencies. The following example defines a token, APP_CONFIG. of the type InjectionToken:

src/app/app.config.ts
import { InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';
export interface AppConfig {
  title: string;
}
export const APP_CONFIG = new InjectionToken<AppConfig>('app.config description');

The optional type parameter, <AppConfig>, and the token description (optional but recommended), app.config description, specify the token's purpose.

Next, register the dependency provider in the component using the InjectionToken object of APP_CONFIG:

src/app/app.component.ts
const MY_APP_CONFIG_VARIABLE: AppConfig = {
  title: 'Hello',
};
providers: [{ provide: APP_CONFIG, useValue: MY_APP_CONFIG_VARIABLE }]

Now, inject the configuration object into the constructor with the @Inject() parameter decorator:

src/app/app.component.ts
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(APP_CONFIG) config: AppConfig) {
    this.title = config.title;
  }
}
<!-- ......................................................................... -->
In Angular, InjectionToken is used as a provider token for dependencies that are not tied to a class, such as objects, arrays, or primitive values (e.g., configuration objects, constants). Since these are not classes, Angular cannot automatically determine how to provide them, so you need to explicitly create a token.

Why Use InjectionToken?
Non-Class Dependencies: Angular typically uses class names as provider tokens. For non-class values like objects, arrays, or strings, you need a unique token to register and inject these values.
Type Safety: InjectionToken allows specifying a type for the value being provided, helping with compile-time type checking.
Avoid Collisions: Strings can also be used as tokens, but they are prone to name collisions. InjectionToken ensures a unique identifier

How to Use InjectionToken
1. Create the InjectionToken
Use InjectionToken to create a unique and type-safe token.

import { InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';

export const APP_CONFIG = new InjectionToken<AppConfig>('app.config');

interface AppConfig {
  apiUrl: string;
  timeout: number;
}

2. Provide the Token in the Module
Use the APP_CONFIG token with useValue to provide the configuration.

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    { 
      provide: APP_CONFIG, 
      useValue: { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', timeout: 3000 } 
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

3. Inject the Token in a Component or Service

Use the @Inject decorator to specify the token when injecting the value.

import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { APP_CONFIG } from './app.config';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `<h1>InjectionToken Example</h1>`,
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(APP_CONFIG) private config: { apiUrl: string; timeout: number }) {
    console.log(`API URL: ${this.config.apiUrl}`);
    console.log(`Timeout: ${this.config.timeout}`);
  }
}

Use Cases
App Configuration: Injecting static configuration data like API URLs or environment settings.
Feature Flags: Injecting boolean or object-based feature flags.
Shared Constants: Injecting reusable constants like dropdown options.

Interfaces and DI

Though the TypeScript AppConfig interface supports typing within the class, the AppConfig interface plays no role in DI. In TypeScript, an interface is a design-time artifact, and does not have a runtime representation, or token, that the DI framework can use.

When the TypeScript transpiles to JavaScript, the interface disappears because JavaScript doesn't have interfaces. Because there is no interface for Angular to find at runtime, the interface cannot be a token, nor can you inject it:

src/app/app.component.ts
// Can't use interface as provider token
[{ provide: AppConfig, useValue: MY_APP_CONFIG_VARIABLE })]

src/app/app.component.ts
export class AppComponent {
  // Can't inject using the interface as the parameter type
  constructor(private config: AppConfig) {}
}


Let's break it down:

What is an interface in TypeScript?

An interface in TypeScript is like a blueprint that defines the structure of an object (e.g., what properties it has and their types). It is only used during development to help catch errors.
What happens to interfaces at runtime?

When TypeScript is converted (transpiled) into JavaScript, the interface disappears because JavaScript doesn’t have the concept of interfaces. It's only a "design-time" tool.
What is Dependency Injection (DI)?

DI is a system in Angular that provides instances of classes or values to parts of your application. For this to work, Angular needs a token to identify what it should provide.
Why can't you use an interface as a token for DI?

Since interfaces don’t exist in the JavaScript version of your code, Angular cannot "see" the interface during runtime. It has no way to use the interface as a token to provide the corresponding value.

Examples in Plain English:
Trying to Use an Interface in DI
You might write:

[{ provide: AppConfig, useValue: MY_APP_CONFIG_VARIABLE }]

Here, AppConfig is an interface. But Angular can't use it because it disappears after transpilation.

Trying to Inject an Interface
You might try:

constructor(private config: AppConfig) {}
Here, you’re asking Angular to inject a value for AppConfig. But Angular can’t do this because it doesn’t know what AppConfig is (it’s gone in JavaScript).

What Should You Do Instead?
You can use a class or a unique token (like a string or InjectionToken) for DI, because these exist at runtime. For example:

import { InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';

// Create a token for DI
export const APP_CONFIG = new InjectionToken<AppConfig>('app.config');

// Use the token to provide the value
providers: [{ provide: APP_CONFIG, useValue: MY_APP_CONFIG_VARIABLE }]

// Inject using the token
constructor(@Inject(APP_CONFIG) private config: AppConfig) {}

This way, Angular knows what to inject because APP_CONFIG exists at runtime.
